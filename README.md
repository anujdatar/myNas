# Simple Nas Setup for home use.
An alternative to OpenMediaVault. Saw a lot of bugs on some ARM SBC builds.

Platform agnostic, should work or Fedora, Debian and Arch based systems. Target
system architectures: AMD64 (x86_64), ARM32 (armhf) and ARM64 (Aarch64).

- Frontend using nuxt3.. testing nuxt3-rc for now
- Backend using shell scripts, initially started with flask, but might use Nuxt3's server
